## Agile Methodology
The project was developed using the Agile methodology. Product backlog is detailed into three levels:<br>
* Epics which is a large quantities of related work, which were five epics for the project. Each of them has a list of features.
* A feature, is a service that delivers value to the end user. 
* Each feature is broken down into a number simpler tasks which are user stories. 

As the user stories were achieved, they were moved from To Do list, to In-Progress, and finally Done lists. You can have a look to the project board [here](https://github.com/users/AlaYousef/projects/4/views/1?layout=board)
